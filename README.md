# Text_To_Speech_py


Two examples, how to convert text with python using jupyter notebook.


### The First method is using a libray by Google, working online.

We are going to use the library "playsound" for to play the file and I had some errors, 
like error 263 or error 265
to fix just run the command "pip uninstall playsound"
and run the command "pip install playsound==1.2.2"

### The Second method is using the library pyttsx3, working offline.
